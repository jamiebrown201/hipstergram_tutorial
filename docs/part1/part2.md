# Creating your project

### 1) The framework

Now it is time to create your masterpiece. Rails makes things easier by providing generators that do a lot of the work for you. The first one we will be running is the 'new' generator. This will set up your project with a foundation of a rails application that we can build upon.

So open your terminal and navigate to a directory where you would like your project to live (if you need any help with the command line codecademy has a great tutorial [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)). Now run:

```rails new hipstergram```

`cd hipstergram` to move into your directory then `ls` to view the ungodly amount of STUFF you just created. Don't fret we will be going over what the most important stuff does throughout but if you want to jump ahead and slightly bore yourself you can find out a bit more about rails file structure visit [here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-directory-structure.htm).

### 2) Getting something on your screen.

Now after all that hard work of typing in one command its time to view what you have created. Time to start up your server, you can do this by running `bin/rails server` in your command line. Wait for it to boot up and then head to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see the starting point of your brand spanking new website, well done.
