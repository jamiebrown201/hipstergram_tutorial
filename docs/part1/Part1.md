Right now time to get started on the good stuff. First of all we are going to make sure we have everything on our system to start using rails. If you know you have ruby installed skip past the prep step

This tutorial assumes you have homebrew installed on your system. To check if you do run `brew -v` in your command line. If it returns a version number then you are good to go, if not follow how to install it [here](http://brew.sh/).

Next to check if you have ruby installed run `ruby -v` and once again if it does not return a version of ruby you will need to install it. This can be done by running `brew install ruby`, now go get yourself a drink (I suggest a cocktail) and wait for ruby to be installed onto your system. Run `ruby -v` again to check everything was installed nicely. If it hasn't tough... only joking just get on google you lazy, lazy person.
